  text: 'Write a COBOL program that processes financial transactions for multiple accounts. The program reads from a sequential file containing records with account numbers, transaction types (D for deposit, W for withdrawal, T for transfer), transaction amounts, and recipient account (for transfers). Your program should:\n1. For each deposit (D), add the transaction amount to the account balance.\n2. For each withdrawal (W), subtract the transaction amount, ensuring that no withdrawal results in a negative balance. If a withdrawal would result in a negative balance, log the error and skip the transaction.\n3. For each transfer (T), move the transaction amount from the source account to the recipient account.\n4. Write valid transactions to a new sequential file, and log any failed transactions (e.g., insufficient funds or invalid account numbers).\n5. Finally, display the updated account balances and log errors.\n\nInput Example:\nTransaction File:\n1. Account 1001, D, $500.00\n2. Account 1002, W, $300.00\n3. Account 1003, T, $200.00, Recipient: 1004\n4. Account 1002, W, $900.00 (insufficient funds)',
