    <div class="section" id="purpose-history">
      <h2>COBOL Purpose and History</h2>
      <p>COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) was developed in 1959 to meet the needs of business data processing. Its creation was driven by the need for a high-level programming language to handle data-centric applications, particularly in business and government.</p>
      <p>COBOL has been used for decades in mission-critical systems, such as banking, insurance, and government services, and is still widely used in legacy systems today.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="language-of-business">
      <h2>COBOL: The Language of Business</h2>
      <p>COBOL was designed for business data processing, making it ideal for applications that handle large volumes of data. Its readability, strict format, and structure made it a preferred choice for large corporations and government institutions.</p>
      <p>COBOL's syntax closely resembles the English language, making it more accessible for business analysts and non-programmers to understand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="origin-grace-hopper">
      <h2>Grace Hopper and the Origin of COBOL</h2>
      <p>Grace Hopper, a pioneering computer scientist, played a significant role in the development of COBOL. She contributed to the creation of early compilers and advocated for machine-independent programming languages, which led to COBOL's design.</p>
      <p>Hopper's work laid the foundation for the development of COBOL, and she is often credited as one of the key figures in the history of the language.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="program-layout">
      <h2>COBOL Program Layout</h2>
      <p>A COBOL program is structured into four main divisions, each serving a different purpose. These divisions are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Identification Division:</strong> Provides metadata about the program, such as its name, author, and version.</li>
        <li><strong>Environment Division:</strong> Describes the environment in which the program is running, such as hardware and software configurations.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Division:</strong> Defines all variables, data structures, and constants used in the program.</li>

    </div>

    <div class="section" id="accepting-input">
      <h2>Accepting User Input in COBOL</h2>
      <p>COBOL allows interaction with the user through the <strong>ACCEPT</strong> statement, which captures input from the user at runtime. Data can be accepted from the console or other sources, such as files or system variables.</p>
      <pre><code>PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    DISPLAY 'Enter your name: '.
    ACCEPT CustomerName.
    DISPLAY 'Hello, ' CustomerName.</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="manipulating-data">
      <h2>Manipulating Data in COBOL</h2>
      <p>In COBOL, you can manipulate data using a variety of statements such as <strong>MOVE</strong>, <strong>ADD</strong>, <strong>SUBTRACT</strong>, <strong>MULTIPLY</strong>, and <strong>DIVIDE</strong>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MOVE:</strong> Transfers data from one variable to another.</li>
        <li><strong>ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE:</strong> Perform arithmetic operations.</li>

    </div>

    <div class="section" id="conditional-statements">
      <h2>Conditional Statements in COBOL</h2>
      <p>COBOL uses the <strong>IF</strong> statement to perform conditional logic. It supports nested conditions and the use of <strong>88 levels</strong> for specific value checks.</p>
      <pre><code>IF Amount > 1000
    DISPLAY 'High Amount'
ELSE
    DISPLAY 'Normal Amount'.</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="loops-perform">
      <h2>Loops and Perform Statements</h2>
      <p>COBOL uses the <strong>PERFORM</strong> statement to create loops. These loops can be used to repeat a section of code a specific number of times or until a condition is met.</p>
      <pre><code>PERFORM UNTIL Counter > 10
    ADD 1 TO Counter
    DISPLAY 'Counter: ' Counter
END-PERFORM.</code></pre>

    <h1>Part II—File Handling</h1>

    <div class="section" id="sequential-files">
      <h2>Sequential Files</h2>
      <p>In COBOL, sequential files are used to store data in a sequence, with each record following the previous one. Sequential files are the most common file format for reading and writing data in a linear order.</p>
      <p>The key steps for working with sequential files are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SELECT Statement:</strong> Connects your program to the external file.</li>
        <li><strong>OPEN Statement:</strong> Prepares the file for reading, writing, or both.</li>
        <li><strong>READ Statement:</strong> Reads data from the file into a COBOL variable.</li>
        <li><strong>WRITE Statement:</strong> Writes data from COBOL variables into the file.</li>
        <li><strong>CLOSE Statement:</strong> Closes the file once processing is complete.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code>SELECT CustomerFile ASSIGN TO 'customer.dat'.

    </div>

    <div class="section" id="indexed-files">
      <h2>Indexed Files</h2>
      <p>Indexed files in COBOL allow random access to records by associating each record with a key. These files are ideal for databases or applications where you need quick access to specific records.</p>
      <p>Key steps for using indexed files:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Defining the file:</strong> Use the <strong>SELECT</strong> statement to specify the key field.</li>
        <li><strong>Reading records:</strong> You can read records in sequence or by searching for a specific key.</li>
        <li><strong>Creating or updating records:</strong> Write new records to the file or update existing ones using the key.</li>
      </ul>
