    <h1>Part 0—COBOL Examples</h1>

    <div class="section" id="hello-world">
      <h2>Example 1: Hello World</h2>
      <p>This is a simple program that displays "Hello, World!" on the screen.</p>
      <pre><code>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. HelloWorld.

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    DISPLAY 'Hello, World!'.
    STOP RUN.</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="user-input">
      <h2>Example 2: Accepting User Input</h2>
      <<p>COBOL allows interaction with the user through the <strong>ACCEPT</strong> statement, which captures input from the user at runtime. Data can be accepted from the console or other sources, such as files or system variables. When running COBOL programs in online compilers, user input is often provided via <strong>STDIN</strong> (Standard Input), meaning you can preload inputs instead of typing them interactively.</p>
  
  <p>In environments where interactive input isn't supported (like some online COBOL compilers), the input is taken from <strong>STDIN</strong> before running the program. You can provide multiple inputs at once, separated by new lines, simulating what would normally be entered interactively.</p>

  <p>For example, if you want to accept multiple inputs, such as a user's name and age, you can write a program like this:</p>
  
  <pre><code>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
    PROGRAM-ID. UserInputProgram.
    
    DATA DIVISION.
    WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
    01 CustomerName PIC X(20).
    01 CustomerAge PIC 9(2).
    
    PROCEDURE DIVISION.
        DISPLAY 'Enter your name: '.
        ACCEPT CustomerName.
        
        DISPLAY 'Enter your age: '.
        ACCEPT CustomerAge.
    
        DISPLAY 'Hello, ' CustomerName ', you are ' CustomerAge ' years old.'.
    
        STOP RUN.</code></pre>
    
  
  <p><strong>Using STDIN:</strong> In online COBOL compilers, such as JDoodle, you can enter inputs like this in the "Input" section (STDIN):</p>
  
  <pre><code>
  John Doe
  30
  </code></pre>

  <p>The program will then take "John Doe" as the value for <strong>CustomerName</strong> and "30" as the value for <strong>CustomerAge</strong>, and output:</p>

  <pre><code>
  Enter your name: 
  Enter your age: 
  Hello, John Doe, you are 30 years old.
  </code></pre>

  <p>This method of using STDIN is crucial for compilers that don't support live user interaction.</p>

      <h2>Introduction to COBOL</h2>
      <p>COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) is a high-level programming language designed for business applications. It was first introduced in 1959 and has been widely used in industries such as finance, government, and business data processing.</p>
      <p>COBOL emphasizes structured programming, readability, and maintainability, making it suitable for large-scale and mission-critical applications. Despite its age, COBOL continues to be used in many legacy systems and is still taught in some computer science programs.</p>

      <h2>COBOL Purpose and History</h2>
      <p>COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) was developed in 1959 to meet the needs of business data processing. Its creation was driven by the need for a high-level programming language to handle data-centric applications, particularly in business and government.</p>
      <p>COBOL has been used for decades in mission-critical systems, such as banking, insurance, and government services, and is still widely used in legacy systems today.</p>

    <div class="section" id="language-of-business">
      <h2>COBOL: The Language of Business</h2>
      <p>COBOL was designed for business data processing, making it ideal for applications that handle large volumes of data. Its readability, strict format, and structure made it a preferred choice for large corporations and government institutions.</p>
      <p>COBOL's syntax closely resembles the English language, making it more accessible for business analysts and non-programmers to understand.</p>

      <h2>Grace Hopper and the Origin of COBOL</h2>
      <p>Grace Hopper, a pioneering computer scientist, played a significant role in the development of COBOL. She contributed to the creation of early compilers and advocated for machine-independent programming languages, which led to COBOL's design.</p>
      <p>Hopper's work laid the foundation for the development of COBOL, and she is often credited as one of the key figures in the history of the language.</p>

    <div class="section" id="date-manipulation">
      <h2>Date Manipulation</h2>
      <p>COBOL includes intrinsic functions for working with dates, such as determining the current system date or calculating the number of days between dates. These functions are important for applications that process dates for billing, payroll, and reporting.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CURRENT-DATE:</strong> Retrieves the current date and time.</li>
        <li><strong>INTEGER-OF-DATE:</strong> Converts a date to an integer for calculations.</li>
        <li><strong>DATE-OF-INTEGER:</strong> Converts an integer back to a date.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code>PROCEDURE DIVISION.
   MOVE FUNCTION CURRENT-DATE TO CurrentDate.
   DISPLAY 'Today''s Date: ' CurrentDate.

   MOVE FUNCTION INTEGER-OF-DATE (20230901) TO DateInt.
   DISPLAY 'Days since 1/1/1601: ' DateInt.

   MOVE FUNCTION DATE-OF-INTEGER (DateInt) TO ActualDate.
   DISPLAY 'Converted Date: ' ActualDate.</code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="intrinsic-functions">
      <h2>Other Intrinsic Functions</h2>
      <p>COBOL provides a range of intrinsic functions for performing mathematical, statistical, financial, and string manipulations. These functions simplify calculations and string handling within your programs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>NUMVAL:</strong> Converts alphanumeric data to numeric.</li>
        <li><strong>MAX:</strong> Returns the maximum value from a list of numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>SUBSTR:</strong> Extracts a substring from a string.</li>
        <li><strong>REVERSE:</strong> Reverses the order of characters in a string.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code>PROCEDURE DIVISION.
   MOVE '123' TO AlphanumericValue.
   COMPUTE NumericValue = FUNCTION NUMVAL (AlphanumericValue).
   DISPLAY 'Numeric Value: ' NumericValue.

   COMPUTE MaximumValue = FUNCTION MAX (5, 10, 15).
   DISPLAY 'Maximum Value: ' MaximumValue.

   MOVE FUNCTION REVERSE ('COBOL') TO ReversedString.
   DISPLAY 'Reversed String: ' ReversedString.</code></pre>

    <div class="section" id="call-interface">
      <h2>The Call Interface</h2>
      <p>COBOL supports calling external programs or subprograms using the <strong>CALL</strong> statement. This allows you to build modular programs where tasks are separated into individual subprograms. Data can be passed between programs via the <strong>LINKAGE SECTION</strong>.</p>
      <p>The <strong>CALL BY REFERENCE</strong> and <strong>CALL BY CONTENT</strong> methods determine how data is passed between the calling and called programs.</p>
      <pre><code>PROCEDURE DIVISION.
   CALL 'SubProgram' USING BY REFERENCE DataItem1
                            BY CONTENT DataItem2.
   DISPLAY 'Returned from SubProgram'.</code></pre>

    <div class="section" id="future-of-cobol">
      <h2>The Future of COBOL</h2>
      <p>Despite its age, COBOL continues to play a crucial role in enterprise systems, especially in sectors like banking, insurance, and government. Efforts to modernize COBOL applications, integrate them with newer technologies, and train a new generation of developers ensure that COBOL will remain relevant for years to come.</p>
      <p>Technologies like cloud computing, API integration, and modernization tools are enabling COBOL applications to work seamlessly with modern architectures, extending their lifespan in the business world.</p>
